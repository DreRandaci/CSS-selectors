# CSS Selectors
___

This Nashville Software School assigment focused on selecting specific elements on an html page utilizing a variety of CSS element selection methods. Below are the assigment requirements (html was provided by instructors):

- The header element should have a 1px border. Color, you pick.
- Convert the ul in the navigation element into a series of horizontal links with # as the href value, without bullets, and have some space between them horizontally.
- Ensure that the navigation is semantically marked as such (i.e. wrap it in the correct HTML tag).
- Any text in an element with class "disabled" should be colored grey, unless it is inside an anchor tag. If inside an anchor, it should be colored purple.
- Any text inside an element with a class of "active" should be colored yellow.
- Section elements should be contained within an article element.
- There are two missing closing tags in this document. Make sure you add them back in.
- Make the "I'm red" text colored red.
- Make the "I'm blue" text colored blue.
- The sibling h4 of the red element should have a background color of red.
- The sibling h4 of the blue element should have background color of blue.
- Any h4 that is a direct child of grandparent should have a 1px border with rounded corners.
- Elements with a class of promo should have bold text that is also colored gold.
- Without adding any other attributes to the input fields in the footer, write a CSS selector that makes any text input field have a height of 25px.
